A python script to test the Monty Hall problem

The Monty Hall problem is based off of an old game show hosted by Monty Hall. There are three doors, behind one of them is a car, behind the others are goats. The player picks a door, then one of the goat doors is revealed, the player can choose to either switch or keep they door they picked. Statistically switching will more often win you the car. This Script tests that, it creates the doors with the goats and the car, then picks a random door, then switches or doesnt switch.

## Findings
As expected, switching is more beneficial. If you switch, you win ~2/3 of the time, if you don't switch you win ~1/3 of the time.
